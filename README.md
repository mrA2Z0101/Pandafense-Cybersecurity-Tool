## üß∞ Dependencies

* **ESP32 Arduino Core**
* **Adafruit\_GFX** and **Adafruit\_SSD1306**
* **NimBLE‚ÄëArduino** (by h2zero)

> Some NimBLE versions change callback signatures. This project uses `NimBLEScanCallbacks` and `setScanCallbacks(&cb, /*wantDuplicates=*/true)`.

---

## üöÄ Quick start

### Arduino IDE

1. Install ESP32 board support.
2. Install the libraries above.
3. Open `firmware/arduino` and build/flash.

### PlatformIO

1. Open `firmware/platformio` in VS Code.
2. `pio run -t upload`.

If the OLED stays blank, scan I¬≤C and confirm **0x3C**. Adjust in the config if needed.

### üõ†Ô∏è Minimal PlatformIO config

Create `firmware/platformio/platformio.ini`:

```ini
[env:esp32dev]
platform = espressif32
board = esp32dev
framework = arduino
monitor_speed = 115200
upload_speed = 921600

lib_deps =
  adafruit/Adafruit GFX Library
  adafruit/Adafruit SSD1306
  h2zero/NimBLE-Arduino

build_flags =
  -D OLED_ADDR=0x3C
  -D CORE_DEBUG_LEVEL=0
```

Project layout expected by PlatformIO:

```
firmware/platformio/
‚îú‚îÄ platformio.ini
‚îî‚îÄ src/
   ‚îî‚îÄ main.cpp   ‚Üê paste your sketch here (convert .ino to .cpp if needed)
```

---

## üîé Detection details (matches source code)

### Deauth

* Listens for 802.11 management frames with subtype **Deauthentication**.
* Any hit sets `deauthDetected` and raises an alert for `ALERT_DURATION`.

### Rogue AP

* Tracks **SSIDs** and the **set of channels** they appear on (`channelsSeen` bitmask).
* When a known SSID shows up on **new channels** repeatedly within **NEW\_CHANNEL\_WINDOW**, increments a counter.
* If the counter reaches **NEW\_CHANNEL\_THRESHOLD (3)** and the BSSID OUI is **not in the whitelist**, it alerts.
* Persistence: SSIDs and channel bitmasks are saved in ESP32 **Preferences** under the `apstore` namespace.

### ARP spoof

* Parses data frames for **LLC/SNAP** type **0x0806** (ARP). Looks for **ARP replies** (op=2).
* Maps `IP ‚Üí {MACs...}` and alerts when **multiple MACs** claim the same IP.
* Works best on **open/unencrypted** networks. Encrypted payloads will hide ARP without association.

### Beacon flood

* Counts beacons per **SSID** within a sliding window. Triggers when counts exceed **BEACON\_THRESHOLD (100)** in **BEACON\_WINDOW\_MS (1000 ms)**.

### BLE jam (prototype)

* Uses NimBLE continuous active scan. Measures **advertisements per second (pps)** in **WINDOW\_MS (3000 ms)** windows.
* Builds a baseline after **WARMUP\_MS (15000 ms)** and **MIN\_BASELINE\_COUNT (60)** frames.
* Alerts when **pps < LOW\_RATIO √ó baseline** for **LOW\_WINDOWS\_TO\_ALERT (3)** windows.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration constants

```cpp
// Button and debounce
const unsigned long DEBOUNCE_DELAY  = 50;      // ms
const unsigned long LONG_PRESS_TIME = 1500;    // ms

// Wi‚ÄëFi scanning
static const unsigned long CHANNEL_HOP_INTERVAL = 200;   // ms, cycles 1‚Äì13
static const unsigned long ALERT_DURATION       = CHANNEL_HOP_INTERVAL * 13 + 500; // visual/audio alert hold
static const unsigned long ROGUE_TIMEOUT        = 500;   // ms
static const unsigned long ARP_TIMEOUT          = 500;   // ms
static const unsigned long BEACON_WINDOW_MS     = 1000;  // ms
static const int           BEACON_THRESHOLD     = 100;   // per SSID per window
static const unsigned long NEW_CHANNEL_WINDOW   = 60000; // ms
static const int           NEW_CHANNEL_THRESHOLD= 3;     // hits before rogue

// OUI whitelist for allowed AP vendors
#define NUM_WHITELIST_OUIS 1
const uint8_t whitelistOUI[NUM_WHITELIST_OUIS][3] = { {0xAA,0xBB,0xCC} };

// OLED
#define OLED_ADDR 0x3C
```

Change GPIOs and thresholds as needed, then rebuild.

## üìà Tuning and testing

* Take a **baseline** in a quiet room. Note beacon and deauth counts.
* Trigger detections in a **controlled lab** on gear you own.
* If rogue AP alerts too easily, raise `NEW_CHANNEL_THRESHOLD` or add OUIs you trust.
* Beacon floods vary by environment. Tweak `BEACON_THRESHOLD` and window length.
* BLE jam detection is heuristic. Expect false positives in very quiet rooms.

---

## üß± Limitations

* Focuses on **2.4 GHz** today. Channel hop spans 1‚Äì13.
* ARP spoof detection is limited on **encrypted** WLANs without association.
* Promiscuous capture can miss frames during heavy bursts.
* BLE jam logic uses traffic statistics. It does **not** demodulate or measure RF energy directly.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

* Implement BLE **Scan/Spoof/Flood** detectors.
* Add **NRF24L01+** and **CC1101** RF scans.
* On‚Äëdevice **config menu**.
* **SD card** or serial logging.
* **JSON** telemetry for dashboards.
* Unit tests for parsers.

Open an issue if you want to help with any item.

---

## üß™ Classroom/lab demos

* **Deauth**: Small burst on a lab AP and client you own. Watch the alert.
* **Rogue AP**: Clone SSID on another channel. Avoid OUIs on your whitelist.
* **Beacon flood**: Short beacon spam burst near the device.
* **ARP spoof**: On an open lab network, run a local ARP poisoner. Observe the conflict.

Keep power low. Do not interfere with others. Get written approval in shared spaces.

---

## üß∞ Troubleshooting

* **No OLED output**: Check 3V3 and GND. Confirm I¬≤C address 0x3C.
* **Button unresponsive**: Verify wiring to GPIO 14 and pull‚Äëup. Adjust `LONG_PRESS_TIME`.
* **No Wi‚ÄëFi detections**: Ensure promiscuous mode is enabled. Try a quieter RF space. Confirm channel hopping.
* **NimBLE compile errors**: Use `NimBLEScanCallbacks` and `onResult(const NimBLEAdvertisedDevice*)`. Some versions omit `onScanEnd`.

## üìö FAQ

**Is this legal?** Use it on your own gear or in a lab you control. Learn the rules where you live.

**Does ARP detection work on WPA2/WPA3?** Only if the traffic is visible. On encrypted WLANs without association, ARP payloads are not readable.

**Why a panda?** Security tools can feel harsh. The panda keeps it friendly while you learn.
